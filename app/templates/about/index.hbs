		<p>What if all the songs you like and play were collected in a radio? What if that radio was available everywhere? And what if you could play your friends' radios, too? There's no need to download an app, you're already here. Welcome to Radio4000!</p>

		<p>No grouping of genres and no playlists to manage. All the music you like and a big fat play button. All tracks are played with the help of YouTube. To add a track to your own radio, you paste in the URL of the YouTube video you like.</p>
