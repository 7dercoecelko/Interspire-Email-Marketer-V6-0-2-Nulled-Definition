		<p>What if all the songs you like and play on different services like YouTube and Soundcloud were collected in a single channel? What if that channel was available everywhere, with your own URL and without having to log in or download an app?</p>
		<p>No grouping of genres or playlists to manage. Just all the music you like together and a big fat play button.</p>
