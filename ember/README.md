This is an Ember.js application scaffolded with Ember-cli. This will get everything working.

1. Make sure you are using the ember-cli master version directly from Github

Clone the repository to your computer and inside the folder, you run these two commands:

`npm uninstall -g ember-cli` (makes sure you don't have a global version)
`git pull` (makes sure the repo is up to date)
`npm link` (makes this folder act as the global ember-cli)

2. Install project dependencies

cd into the project folder and run

`npm install && bower install`

## Development server

* `ember server`
* Visit your app at http://localhost:4200.

## Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`
