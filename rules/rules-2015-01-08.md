Hello,

For a project I am working on I have been trying to write some security rules but it has been a Fail so far.

The stack is Ember + Firebase.

## Expected (plain english) rules behavior

### User
+ created by anybody (firebase simple login) who does not already has a user
+ written only by this.user: registered + logged in + $userID matches
    name: read: false
    email: 
    provider:
    created:
    channels:
    favoriteChannels:


### Track
+ read by anybody
+ written by user: registered + logged in + has channel + has this track ID in his channel 'tracks'
+ created by user who is: registered + logged in + has a channel
    url:
    title:
    body:
    created:
    channel:
    
### Image
+ read by anybody
+ written by user: registered + logged in + has channel + has this track ID in his channel 'tracks'
+ created by user who is: registered + logged in + has a channel
    channel:
    src:

### Channel

+ read by anybody (logged out, not registered)
+ written only by the channel owner
+ created only by a user that: is registered and logged in, does not already have a channel (user can only have one channel)
    title:
    slug:
    created:
    body:
    images:
    tracks:
    user:

## Ember models (4):

### User 
    import DS from 'ember-data';

    export default DS.Model.extend({
    	name:
	    email: DS.attr('string'),
	    provider: DS.attr('string'),
    	created: DS.attr('number'),
    	channels: DS.hasMany('channel', {
	        	async: true
    	}),
	    favoriteChannels: DS.hasMany('channel', {
		    inverse: null,
    		async: true
	    })
    });


### Track

    import DS from 'ember-data';

    export default DS.Model.extend({
	    url: DS.attr('string'),
    	title: DS.attr('string', { defaultValue: 'Untitled' }),
    	body: DS.attr('string'),
    	created: DS.attr('number'),
    	channel: DS.belongsTo('channel', { async: true })
    });
    
### Image

    import DS from 'ember-data';

    export default DS.Model.extend({
	    channel: DS.hasMany('channel'),
    	src: DS.attr('string'),
    });

### Channel

    import DS from 'ember-data';

    export default DS.Model.extend({
	    title: DS.attr('string'),
    	slug: DS.attr('string'),
	    created: DS.attr('number'),
    	body: DS.attr('string'),
	    images: DS.hasMany('image', { async: true }),
    	tracks: DS.hasMany('track', { async: true }),
    	user: DS.belongsTo('user', {
	        	inverse: 'channels',
    		async: true
	    })
    });
