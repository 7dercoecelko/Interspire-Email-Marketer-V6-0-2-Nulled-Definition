		<h3>How do I create another channel?</h3>
		<p>You can't. You have one single channel to present your music taste. Put it on shuffle and enjoy your music instead of worrying about genres and playlists.</p>

		<h3>How do I change the URL of my channel?</h3>
		<p>Go to your channel, tap <em>'Edit'</em> and look for <em>'Permalink'</em>.</p>

		<h3>How do I add tracks from Soundcloud etc.?</h3>
		<p>For now, you can only add tracks from YouTube. We're considering other sources.</p>

		<h3>Why doesn't it play on my precious iPhone and iPad?</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately Apple decided to disallow autoplaying of videos on iOS. While we work around it, we suggest you buy an Android device.</p>
