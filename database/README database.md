# Radio4000 database

This is a script that refactors our DB. Kept here in case we need it again.

1. Download our complete `database.json` from Firebase.
2. Save it in a global js var in `db.js`.
3. Refactor using db.js to do what you want.
4. Open browser developer console and type `console.save(db)`

This gives you a `console.json` in your Downloads folder. And that's how to refactor the DB "easily".
