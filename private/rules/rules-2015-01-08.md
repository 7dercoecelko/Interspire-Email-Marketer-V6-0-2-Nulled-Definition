Hello,

For a project (stack: Ember + Firebase) I am working on I have been trying to write some security rules but it has been a huge Fail so far.
I've used the Blaze Compiler way to write the rules (for its expected clarity). It is not a success. Writing it the normal json way is also a fail.

I have two questions, the second is the most important to be solved - being to one separating us from the prototype release.

Thank you in advance for your help.

# Preliminary question

When a user registers to our app (Firebase authentication) his record id becomes 'provider:user_id' and it is then this record_id that will be used in the relations between our different models. If a person (hacker) inspect the application with the Ember inspector or the Firebase Inspector he can easily find this record_id and then find the user name by a simple url following this scheme 'provider.com/id'.
Is there a way to make this data totally anonymous so our users cannot be found on the social network they used to log in our application.

PS: using Firebase 'mail' authentication could be a solution, but we would also like to enable the 'social authentifications'

# Expected (plain english) rules behavior

Here are a plain english version of what we thought to be the needed rules for the application to work 'as expected'.
We wrote them according to our Ember models structure, that you can find in the next (3rd) chapter.

## User
- only non register (& non logged-in) user should be able to create an account
- only this.user can edit himself
- a user cannot edit an other user
- a logged in user cannot create a new user

name: only this.user can read, other user cannot read this property
email: only this.user can read, other user cannot read this property
provider: only this.user can read, other user cannot read this property
created: only this.user can read, other user cannot read this property
channels: all user can read this property, even non logged-in user

## Track
- any user can read every track (logged-in or not)
- can be created by user who is: registered + logged in + has a channel
- can be edited by user who created this track (which means registered + logged in + has a channel)

## Image
- any user can read every image (logged-in or not)
- can be created by user who is: registered + logged in + has a channel + has an empty image record (because if not empty he cannot create a new image, but he can only edit the existing one he has attached to his channel)
- can be edited by user who created this image (which means registered + logged in + has a channel + has this image attached to his channel)

## Channel
- can be read by anybody (logged-in or not)
- can be written/edited only by the channel owner (user who has the channel id in his $user.channels record )
- created only by a user that: is registered and logged in, does not already have a channel (user can only have one channel)

# Ember models (4):

## User
    export default DS.Model.extend({
    	name:
	    email: DS.attr('string'),
	    provider: DS.attr('string'),
    	created: DS.attr('number'),
    	channels: DS.hasMany('channel', {
	        	async: true
    	}),
	    favoriteChannels: DS.hasMany('channel', {
		    inverse: null,
    		async: true
	    })
    });

## Track
    export default DS.Model.extend({
	    url: DS.attr('string'),
    	title: DS.attr('string', { defaultValue: 'Untitled' }),
    	body: DS.attr('string'),
    	created: DS.attr('number'),
    	channel: DS.belongsTo('channel', { async: true })
    });

## Image
    export default DS.Model.extend({
	    channel: DS.hasMany('channel'),
    	src: DS.attr('string'),
    });

## Channel
    export default DS.Model.extend({
	    title: DS.attr('string'),
    	slug: DS.attr('string'),
	    created: DS.attr('number'),
    	body: DS.attr('string'),
	    images: DS.hasMany('image', { async: true }),
    	tracks: DS.hasMany('track', { async: true }),
    	user: DS.belongsTo('user', {
	        	inverse: 'channels',
    		async: true
	    })
    });
