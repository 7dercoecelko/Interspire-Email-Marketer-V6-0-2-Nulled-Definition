## Important if you use Sublime Text

Sublime automatically watches all files in a folder. Because ember-cli is so huge your PC will slow down. To solve this, tell Sublime to ignore the `tmp` and `node_modules` folder: http://www.ember-cli.com/#sublime-text

## Emberfire

We use Firebase as our backend through Ember Data and [Emberfire](https://github.com/firebase/emberfire).

## Google API

We're using the YouTube API so you might run into trouble with permissions, domains etc. If so, check here https://console.developers.google.com/project/much-play/

## Firebase security rules

Firebase rules are a bitch but see the `rules` folder.
